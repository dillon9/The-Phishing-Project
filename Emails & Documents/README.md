# The Art of SE

When writing good emails and accompanying documents, there are a few things to keep in mind,

- Keep it publicly available, a test that uses insider knowledge to spear phish employees demonstrates nothing
- Know your audience, if targeting R&D, they're not going to be responsive to Policy Change X
- Avoid phishing language, "URGENT READ NOW", "ACTION REQUIRED" etc., it is a red flag to anyone that has been even half paying attention during training
- Documents that need to be macros to operate are rare, keep your explanation simple and believable
- Positive messages resonate with people much better than negative ones
- Your first email, is your only shot. Once phishing is on people's mind they will be extra wary of emails for a few days
- Make sure your email is either the first thing in their inbox in the morning, or the last thing. No one is thinking properly first thing in the morning, or 15 minutes before heading home

The examples in each folder have been disarmed and it is recommended you design your own. These were all designed with a specific engagement in mind. The reason you may find duplicates of a certain type of email/document is because when the template is being downloaded, the name is briefly visible. This is important to keep in mind, as it costs nothing to make several copies and rename them. Attention to detail will usually win the day.
