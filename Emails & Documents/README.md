# The Art of SE

When writing good emails and accompanying emails, there are a few things to keep in mind,

- Keep it publicly available, a test that uses insider knowledge to spear phish employees demonstrates nothing
- Know your audience, if targeting R&D, they're not going to be responsive to Policy Change X
- Avoid phishing language, "URGENT READ NOW", etc.
- Documents that need to be macros to operate are rare, keep your explanation simple and believable
- Positive messages resonate with people much better than negative ones
- Your first email, is your only shot. Once phishing is on people's mind they will be extra wary of emails for a few days
