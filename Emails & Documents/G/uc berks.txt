Hi [Employee],

I've across a resource from UC Berkeley that has reshaped my workflow. I'll talk about it during the next meeting. It's an early version and it is encrypted because it hasn't been released publicly yet. You'll need to enable contents to view it. I'd appreciate feedback on the usefulness of this and I'm starting to compile additional resources so please send along anything you have. Hope you're staying safe out there.

Best,
[spoofed name]
