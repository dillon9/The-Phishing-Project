Subj Policy Change

Hi [employee],

I wanted to share with you some changes about policy B. I am trying out a new kind of Word doc where you will be able to give feedback from within. To share your thoughts you will need to enable contents. I am looking forward to your feedback, and I hope you're staying safe.

Best,
[spoofed name]
